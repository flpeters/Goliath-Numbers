# Goliath-Numbers
An attempt to find the first [Goliath number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbfLl0IxL9o) - inspired by [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile)


A Goliath number is a number of the form $2^n$ which contains the digit sequence `666` repeated 666 times in a row, meaning 1998 consecutive sixes.

`Main.ipynb` contains the most current version of the algorithm and everything needed to run the search.  
`Algorithm Optimization.ipynb` has all of the different versions of the algorithm and the thought process and experimentation which have led to the current algorithm.
